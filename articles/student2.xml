            <p>The demand for more manufacturing space caused the relocation of communities into Boyle Heights. The percentage of Latinos today is 94.0% which exceeds the white population of 2.0% and other at 0.7%.  The average number of people per household is about 3.8 and the average income is between 700-2,000. There is a significant disparity in race, for instance, the total population comes in at around 45,903, the non-Hispanic or Latino population make up for 1,049, while the Mexican population constitutes the majority at 39,724 and the other Hispanic and Latino population combined makeup for about 5,014, which included Puerto Ricans and Cubans. However, the gender difference was only about 200, where women made up 22,866 and men 23,037 and as far as the housing repair conditions were concerned, they ranged from poor to fair. I also found similar job occupations which included, factory workers, laborers, some businessmen, and WPA workers.</p>
